Modeling fiber-reinforced tissues is almost impossible to measure experimentally, which is why we use FEMs to predict tissue mechanics. Based off previous literature, I worked with a 3 layer flat-plate model inscribed with fibers, and it turns out finding a mesh that accurately describes contact regions, accounts for unique material assignment, and accomodates to FEBio simulation parameters is easier said than done.
