Modeling fiber-reinforced tissues is almost impossible to measure experimentally, which is why we use FEMs to predict tissue mechanics. Based off [previous literature](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15BXex3SIRjGp0NvJORVRfQm4CWY7zlnf/view?usp=sharing), I worked with a 3 layer flat-plate model inscribed with fibers, and it turns out finding a mesh that accurately describes contact regions, accounts for unique material assignment, and accommodates to FEBio simulation parameters is easier said than done.
