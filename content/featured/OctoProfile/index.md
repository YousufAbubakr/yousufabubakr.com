Idiopathic scoliosis is a form of scoliosis where the spine develops an abnormal curve, but its cause isn’t definitive. Among adolescents, idiopathic scoliosis is among the most common spinal disorders in children, [affecting up to 5% of the adolescent population and grows in prevalence with respect to age](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24432052/). Despite the prevalence of this disorder, standardized remedial procedures such as posterior spinal fusion (PSF) are heavily invasive and oftentimes result in a lack of mobility and growth in the long term. Anterior vertebral body tethering (AVBT) is an emerging, alternative method that relies on the body’s growth potential to naturally correct the angular deformities of the spine. This body of work uses a computational finite element modeling (FEM) framework to investigate how different tethering techniques affects growth plate stress distributions.
