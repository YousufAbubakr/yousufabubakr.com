If 2D flow can be approximated as irrotational and incompressible, it can be described by a streamfunction Ψ(x) satisfying Laplace’s equation (Poisson’s equation with a zero forcing function). In this task, the Laplace PDE was numerically solved to compute the flow and pressure field around the NACA 5012 airfoil.
