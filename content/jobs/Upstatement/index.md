- Developed 3+ ANSYS Meshing models by optimizing node/element features to account for node conformity at contact regions, unique material assignments, and simulation parameters in [FEBio](https://febio.org) (Biomechanics solver)
- Enhanced validation of FEM bovine model by constructing 7+ experiments in FEBio to verify mechanical properties of model over multiple loading modalities and physical, experimental data
- Modeled 4+ biphasic and triphasic tissue structures in FEBio to examine stress and strain distributions and to simulate transport of solvent, ion, and water contents in fiber-reinforced tissues
- Assembled FEA data from FEBio in MATLAB to categorize, curve-fit, and graph results of computational models
- [NSF REU Summer 2021](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/)
