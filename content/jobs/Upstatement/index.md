- Used experimental testing framework to guide FEA modeling of 7+ multi-scale tissue and joint level models
- Enhanced validation of FEA models to verify mechanical properties over multiple loading modalities and physical data
- Post-processed and analyzed stress and strain distributions in fiber-reinforced tissues in MATLAB and Paraview
- Tested 10+ IVD tissue samples in uniaxial loading conditions to investigate chemical and anisotropic disc characteristics
- Parameterized scoliotic joint level model to measure and validate how varying degrees of surgical corrective tethering techniques impact long term spinal growth and health
