- Enhanced validation of FEM bovine model by constructing 7+ experiments in FEBio to verify mechanical properties of model over multiple loading modalities and physical, experimental data
- Computed parameter optimization of Hydrogel/scaffold model in collaboration with i3s Institute to calculate model parameters that minimized desired displacement in biomaterials for tissue engineering
- Modeled 3+ biphasic and triphasic tissue structures in FEBio to examine stress and strain distributions and to simulate transport of solvent, ion, and water contents in fiber-reinforced tissues
- Assembled FEA data from FEBio in MATLAB to categorize, curve-fit, and graph results of computational models
