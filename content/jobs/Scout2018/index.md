- Co-led manufacturing of 30+ squared meters of aluminum and Nomex composite sandwich panels for exterior shell and interior structural panels of solar vehicle
- Optimized interior structural composite frame of vehicle by iterating design of chassis to fit driver configurations, additional interior mechanical systems, and vehicle impact loading conditions
- Validated aerodynamic performance of solar vehicle by performing wind tunnel tests and over 60+ CFD simulations in ANSYS to strengthen understanding of flow conditions on vehicle
- Enhanced design of shell in SolidWorks by refining surface modeling of our vehicleâ€™s geometry to reach appropriate 0.00+ degree draft angles to prepare for molding and manufacturing of exterior shell for vehicle
