- Validated aerodynamic performance of solar vehicle by performing over 30+ Flow tests in ANSYS Fluent to strengthen understanding of weather conditions impact on vehicle and to forecast driving techniques in future races
- Optimized design of shell in SolidWorks by refining surface modeling of our vehicleâ€™s geometry to reach appropriate 0.00+ degree draft angles to prepare for molding and manufacturing of exterior shell for vehicle
- Parameterized enclosure size and mesh refinement to evaluate impact of modeling variables on ANSYS simulations
- Conducted 4+ PDR (Preliminary Design Reviews) with CalSol managers, alumni, and General Motor representatives
