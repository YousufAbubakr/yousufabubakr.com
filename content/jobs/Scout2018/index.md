- Co-led manufacturing of 20+ squared meters of aluminum and kevlar-hexcore composite sandwich panels for exterior shell of new solar vehicle
- Validated aerodynamic performance of solar vehicle by performing over 30+ Flow tests in ANSYS Fluent to strengthen understanding of weather conditions impact on vehicle and to forecast driving techniques in future races
- Optimized design of shell in SolidWorks by refining surface modeling of our vehicleâ€™s geometry to reach appropriate 0.00+ degree draft angles to prepare for molding and manufacturing of exterior shell for vehicle
- Investigated model stability by parameterizing meshing features and conducting mesh convergence studies to evaluate validity of ANSYS Fluent simulations
