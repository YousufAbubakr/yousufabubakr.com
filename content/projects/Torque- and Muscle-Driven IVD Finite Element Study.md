Intervertabral discs are the "shock absorbers" of our spine, and despite their physiological relevance in our daily lives, we have a very limited understanding of its biomechanics and failure mechanisms. Past experiemental and computational methods simplify loading modalities, notably, for example, that the Instantaneous Center of Rotation is physically on the disc under torque and muscle driven loads, which is not generally true. This paper takes a computational approach in challenging this assumption and in doing so predicts herniation (bulging of the AF region) that ultimately can advance our understanding of disc failure mechanics.
