Intervertabral discs are the "shock absorbers" of our spine, and despite the great deal of physiological flexibility they offer us, we have a very limited understanding of their biomechanics and failure mechanisms. Past experiemental and computational models have simplified loading modalities, notably, for example, the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) and its physical location in the central AF region on the disc under torque and muscle driven loads, which is not generally true. This paper takes a computational approach in challenging this assumption and in doing so predicts herniation (bulging of the AF region) that ultimately can advance our understanding of disc failure mechanics.
