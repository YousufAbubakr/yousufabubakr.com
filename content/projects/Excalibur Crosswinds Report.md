At high velocities, aerodynamic loads are hands-down the largest source of power consumption for solar vehicles, and in general, crosswinds, or winds with a component parallel and perpendicular to the line of travel, can drastically impact the aerodynamic performace of these class of vehicles. This project provides a computational framework in assessing the crosswind performance for Excalibur, Calsol's 10th generation vehicle.
